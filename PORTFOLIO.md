# Connections Plus - Portfolio Project

A sophisticated daily word puzzle game that reimagines NYT Connections with innovative multi-level progression and strategic "red herring" mechanics.

## üéØ Project Overview

**Connections Plus** is a full-stack web application that transforms the classic word connection game into a multi-level experience with accumulating complexity. Built as a daily puzzle platform with comprehensive admin tools and player tracking.

### Key Innovation: The Red Herring Strategy
Unlike traditional Connections, this game introduces **red herring words** that carry forward across levels, creating layers of misdirection until they're revealed as their own "Double Meanings" group in the final level.

## üèó Technical Architecture

### Frontend Excellence
- **Next.js 15.5.3** with App Router and **React 19.1.0** for cutting-edge development
- **TypeScript** throughout for type safety and developer experience
- **Turbopack Integration** for 10x faster builds and hot reloading
- **HeroUI** component library for polished, accessible UI components
- **Tailwind CSS v4** for utility-first styling and responsive design
- **Framer Motion 12.23** for professional animations and transitions
- **Suspense Boundaries** for improved error handling and loading states

### Backend & Data
- **Redis Cloud** for high-performance data storage and caching
- **Next.js API Routes** for serverless backend functionality
- **Claude AI API** integration for intelligent word generation
- **Basic Authentication** middleware for admin security
- **RESTful API Architecture** with 9 comprehensive endpoints

### Key Technical Features
- **Anonymous Player Tracking** using localStorage + cookies (privacy-first)
- **Daily Puzzle System** with UTC midnight cutoffs and timezone handling
- **Real-time Progress Saving** to Redis with optimistic updates
- **Dynamic Grid System** handling 17-19 words with elegant overflow
- **Date-based Game Scheduling** with interactive calendar interface
- **Multi-pass Shuffle Algorithm** using enhanced Fisher-Yates for true randomization
- **Development Mode** with local JSON loading for testing

## üéÆ Game Design & Logic

### Multi-Level Progression System
```
Level 1: 17 words (16 regular + 1 red herring)
Level 2: 18 words (16 regular + 2 accumulated red herrings)  
Level 3: 19 words (16 regular + 3 accumulated red herrings)
Level 4: 16 words (12 regular + 4 red herrings as final group)
```

### Strategic Complexity
- Red herrings from early levels might actually belong to groups in later levels
- Creates sophisticated misdirection and "aha!" moments
- Culminates in epic Level 4 reveal of the "Double Meanings" group
