you are a great game designer and I am a software engineer. You created the popular game Connections and it's had a pretty good run. However, the game has one flaw: the player only has to make three successful groups to win, not four, as once they complete three, the game is essentially over and the four remaining words are in a group by default. However, wouldn't it be more interesting if the game had 17 words instead of 16, with one word being similar yet not part of a group/theme?
